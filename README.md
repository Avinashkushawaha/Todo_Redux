# Todo List

 This To-Do List application is a task management tool built using React, Redux, and LocalStorage. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, ensuring efficient organization of daily tasks.

## Uses Technology
- React provides a dynamic and interactive UI.
- Redux manages the global state, ensuring seamless updates across components.
- LocalStorage preserves tasks even after page reloads, enhancing user experience.

### Additional Notes:

1. **Redux Store Setup**: I added a basic example of how to configure your Redux store. Make sure you explain how your store is set up, especially if you're using middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.
   
2. **React Router**: If you're using React Router for navigation, make sure to mention it in the "Technologies" section and include any setup instructions.

3. **API Calls**: If your project makes API calls, include details on how API communication is done (e.g., using Axios, Fetch API, etc.) and any setup required.

4. **Styling**: You can mention the styling approach you're using, like Styled Components or plain CSS, depending on your project setup.

Feel free to modify this further based on your project's needs!
